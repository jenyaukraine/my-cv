## Summary

Senior Software Architect with strong system thinking and deep hands-on engineering experience. Specialized in designing, restructuring, and scaling complex platforms — from legacy monoliths to modern modular architectures.

Experienced in building systems that must operate reliably under real-world constraints: high load, distributed devices, unstable networks, long lifecycle products, and evolving business requirements.

Strong at:

- turning chaotic systems into clean, maintainable architectures  
- building developer-friendly platforms and workflows  
- leading technical direction without micromanagement  
- owning the whole lifecycle: idea → architecture → implementation → production  
- integrating security and reliability into architecture from day one  

I don’t just write code — I design systems that survive growth, refactors, and organizational change.

## Architecture Philosophy

- Prefer **simple architectures that scale**, not over-engineered systems
- Strong separation between:
  - domain logic
  - infrastructure
  - UI
- Systems must be:
  - debuggable
  - observable
  - replaceable
- Security and maintainability are architectural concerns, not afterthoughts
- Refactors are strategic investments, not cosmetic cleanup
- Architecture should enable developers, not slow them down

---

## Typical Responsibilities

- Define and evolve system architecture
- Break monoliths into maintainable modules
- Design data models and API contracts
- Own critical performance and security paths
- Guide frontend architectural decisions
- Design long-term platform strategy
- Mentor engineers in architectural thinking
- Translate business chaos into technical clarity
